      <p>Express.js, commonly referred to as Express, is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Features of Express:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Application Framework:</strong> Express is primarily used as a web application framework for Node.js. It provides routing, middleware, and other utilities to handle HTTP requests and responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal and Unopinionated:</strong> Express is minimal and unopinionated, allowing developers to structure their applications as they see fit without imposing any specific architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP Utility Methods and Middleware:</strong> Express offers various HTTP utility methods and middleware functions to simplify server-side programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Template Engines:</strong> Express can integrate with template engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars for server-side rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> Express is commonly used to build RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Applications:</strong> With libraries like Socket.IO, Express can also be used to build real-time applications.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>Below is a basic example of an Express server:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(\`Server listening at http://localhost:\${port}\`);
});`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <p>Express.js is a powerful and versatile web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a rich set of features, middleware, and utilities, while also allowing developers the freedom to customize and structure their applications according to their requirements.</p>
