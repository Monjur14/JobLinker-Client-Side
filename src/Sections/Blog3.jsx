      <p>Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) web applications. It is built on top of React, providing many powerful features to streamline the development process.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Features of Next.js:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Server-side Rendering (SSR):</strong> Next.js allows you to render React components on the server-side, improving performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered HTML to the client.</li>
        <li><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG):</strong> Next.js supports static site generation, where pages can be pre-built at build time, resulting in faster loading times and improved SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Code Splitting:</strong> Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, allowing for faster page loads and better performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Next.js provides a file-based routing system, where each page corresponds to a file in the pages directory, making it simple to create and manage routes.</li>
        <li><strong>API Routes:</strong> Next.js allows you to create API routes easily, enabling serverless functions for handling backend logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Static File Serving:</strong> Next.js serves static files directly, making it easy to include assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Static Optimization:</strong> Next.js automatically optimizes your application for production, including code minification, image optimization, and more.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>Below is a basic example of a Next.js page:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`import React from 'react';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>This is a basic Next.js page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;`}
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <p>Next.js is a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. With features like SSR, SSG, automatic code splitting, and routing, Next.js simplifies the development of fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications.</p>
